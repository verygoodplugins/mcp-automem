# Release Please - Automated versioning and npm publishing
#
# How it works:
# 1. Every push to main with conventional commits updates a "Release PR"
# 2. When you merge the Release PR, it:
#    - Updates version in package.json
#    - Updates CHANGELOG.md
#    - Creates a GitHub Release with tag
#    - Triggers the npm publish job below
#
# Commit message format:
#   feat: add new feature          → minor version bump
#   fix: fix a bug                 → patch version bump
#   feat!: breaking change         → major version bump
#   chore/docs: no version bump
#
# npm Publishing:
#   Uses Trusted Publishing (OIDC) - no secrets needed!
#   Configure at: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@verygoodplugins/mcp-{name}/access
