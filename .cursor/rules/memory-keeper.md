# Memory Keeper Agent

You MUST use memory tools proactively throughout every conversation to maintain persistent context across all projects.

## Automatic Memory Pattern (AutoMem)

### 1. CONVERSATION START (First message)
```
ALWAYS start by recalling relevant context:

mcp_memory_recall_memory({
  query: "<user's task or question>",
  limit: 5,
  tags: ["<project-name>", "cursor"]  // Use actual project name from package.json, git, or directory
})
```

If memories are found, briefly acknowledge them:
- "I see we previously worked on X..."
- "Based on past context..."
- "I remember we decided..."

### 2. DURING CONVERSATION (Continuous)

Store memories when:
- **Decisions are made**: Architecture choices, library selections, pattern decisions
- **Bugs are fixed**: Root cause, solution, prevention strategy
- **Patterns emerge**: Reusable code patterns, best practices discovered
- **Complex code is written**: Non-obvious implementations that future sessions should know
- **User shares preferences**: Coding style, tool preferences, workflow preferences

Example:
```javascript
// After fixing a bug
mcp_memory_store_memory({
  content: "[BUG-FIX] <component> failing on edge case. Root cause: <root-cause>. Solution: <solution>. Files: <files>",
  tags: ["<project-name>", "cursor", "bug-fix", "<component>", "<YYYY-MM>"],
  importance: 0.8,
  metadata: {
    type: "bug_fix",
    component: "<component>",
    files_modified: ["<files>"]
  }
})
```

### 3. CONVERSATION END (When wrapping up)

Create a summary memory if:
- Multiple files were modified
- Significant refactoring occurred
- New features were added
- Important decisions were made

Example:
```javascript
mcp_memory_store_memory({
  content: "[SESSION] <summary>. Impact: <impact>.",
  tags: ["<project-name>", "cursor", "<type>", "<YYYY-MM>"],
  importance: 0.9,
  metadata: {
    type: "<type>",
    session_duration_minutes: <duration>,
    files_modified: ["<files>"]
  }
})
```

## Memory Quality Guidelines

### Content Structure
```
[TYPE] Brief title. Context and details. Impact/outcome.

Where TYPE is one of:
- [DECISION] - Architectural or design decisions
- [PATTERN] - Reusable patterns discovered
- [BUG-FIX] - Bug fixes with root cause
- [FEATURE] - New features or capabilities
- [OPTIMIZATION] - Performance improvements
- [CONFIG] - Configuration changes
- [REFACTOR] - Code refactoring
```

### Tag Requirements
ALWAYS include:
- `<project-name>` - Project identifier (auto-detect from package.json, git, or directory name)
- `cursor` - Source platform  
- `<YYYY-MM>` - Current month (e.g., `2025-09`)
- Component tag: specific to your project
- Type tag: `decision`, `pattern`, `bug-fix`, `feature`, `optimization`

### Importance Scoring
- 0.9-1.0: Critical decisions, major features, breaking changes
- 0.7-0.9: Important patterns, significant bugs, new integrations
- 0.5-0.7: Helpful patterns, minor features, config changes
- 0.3-0.5: Small fixes, temporary workarounds, notes

## Retrieval Strategy

### At Conversation Start
Always search with:
1. User's task/question as query
2. Tags: `["<project-name>", "cursor"]` (use actual detected project name)
3. Optional time filter if user mentions "recent" or specific timeframe

### During Implementation
Proactively recall when:
- Starting work on a component you haven't seen before
- User mentions something that might have prior context
- Encountering an error or unexpected behavior
- Making architectural decisions

### Search Patterns
```javascript
// Broad search for related work
mcp_memory_recall_memory({
  query: "<component> patterns",
  tags: ["<project-name>", "<component>"]
})

// Specific component search
mcp_memory_recall_memory({
  query: "<specific-query>",
  tags: ["<project-name>", "<tag>"],
  time_query: "last 30 days"
})

// Error/bug related
mcp_memory_recall_memory({
  query: "<error-message>",
  tags: ["<project-name>", "bug-fix"]
})
```

## Memory Associations

When storing related memories, create associations:

```javascript
// Store main memory
const memory1 = await mcp_memory_store_memory({...});

// Store related memory
const memory2 = await mcp_memory_store_memory({...});

// Link them
await mcp_memory_associate_memories({
  memory1_id: memory1.id,
  memory2_id: memory2.id,
  type: "RELATES_TO",
  strength: 0.8
})
```

Association types:
- `RELATES_TO`: General relationship
- `LEADS_TO`: Causal relationship (A caused B)
- `EVOLVED_INTO`: Iterative improvement
- `CONTRADICTS`: Conflicting approaches (mark old one)

## Anti-Patterns (DON'T DO THIS)

❌ **Don't store trivial changes**
```javascript
// BAD: Too granular
mcp_memory_store_memory({
  content: "Fixed typo in comment",
  importance: 0.5
})
```

❌ **Don't store without tags**
```javascript
// BAD: Missing required tags
mcp_memory_store_memory({
  content: "Updated config",
  tags: [] // Missing project, platform, component tags
})
```

❌ **Don't forget to recall at start**
```javascript
// BAD: Starting implementation without context
// User: "Fix the bug"
// You: "Sure, let me check the code..." (without recalling memories)

// GOOD:
// 1. First recall memories about bugs
// 2. Then check code
```

❌ **Don't store passwords/secrets**
```javascript
// BAD: Sensitive data
mcp_memory_store_memory({
  content: "API key is sk_1234567890",
  ...
})
```

## Success Metrics

You're using memory well when:
✅ Every conversation starts with memory recall
✅ Important code changes are captured with context
✅ Future sessions can pick up where you left off
✅ User notices improved continuity across sessions
✅ Less time spent re-explaining context

Remember: Memory is your persistent brain. Use it aggressively!
